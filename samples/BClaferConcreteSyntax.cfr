 * Spec Patterns website: http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/
 *
 * ==== Behavior definitions =====
 ****** 1) Absence pattern: http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/documentation/patterns/absence.shtml
 *
 * P is false: Globally, Before R, After Q, Between Q and R, After Q until R 
 * 
 * Globally: $global(P == false)
 * If not specified, the scope is global or the max scope corresponding to the indentation style. 
 * So $global can be removed.
 * 
 * Before R: 
 * After Q:
 * Between Q and R:
 * After Q until R:
 *
 * Global or Universal or Always operator ($GLOBAL)
 * $GLOBAL(A) (property A has to hold on the entire path from the current state)
 *
 *
 ****** 5) Precedence pattern: http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/documentation/patterns/precedence.shtml
 * S precedes P = "some cause precedes each effect"
 * 
 * Globally: S $precedes P
 * since we don't specify the scope at all, here the scope is global or the max scope corresponding to 
 * the indentation style. 
 * 
 * Before R: S $precedes P $before R
 * $PrecedesBefore(S,P,R) = "S precedes P before R happens (if R actually happens)"
 *
 * After Q: S $precedes P $after Q
 * $PrecedesAfter(S,P,Q) = "S precedes P after Q happens (if Q actually occurs)"
 *
 * Between Q and R:
 * S $precedes P $between [Q,R)
 * S $precedes P $between Q and R
 * S $precedes P $between [Q,R]
 * $PrecedesBetween(S,P,Q,R) = "S precedes P between Q and R (with or without R? this needs to be decided"
 * 
 * After Q until R:
 * S $precedes P $after_until [Q,R)
 * S $precedes P $after Q $until R
 * S $precedes P $after_until [Q,R] -- this also includes R
 * $PrecedesAfterUntil(S,P,Q,R) = "S precedes P after Q until R (with or without R? this needs to be decided!)"
 *
 ******* 6) Response pattern: http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/documentation/patterns/ctl.shtml#Response
 * S responds to P = "some effect follows each cause"
 *
 **Precedence & Response patterns aren't equivalent.
 **Response pattern allows effects to occur without causes.
 **Precedence pattern allows causes to occur without subsequent effects.
 *
 * Globally: S $respondsTo P
 * since we don't specify the scope at all, here the scope is global or the max scope corresponding to 
 * the indentation style. 
 * 
 * Before R: S $respondsTo P $before R
 * $RespondsToBefore(S,P,R) = "S responds to P before R happens (if R actually happens)"
 *
 * After Q: S $respondsTo P $after Q
 * $RespondsToAfter(S,P,Q) = "S responds to P after Q happens (if Q actually occurs)"
 *
 * Between Q and R:
 * S $respondsTo P $between [Q,R)
 * S $respondsTo P $between Q and R
 * S $respondsTo P $between [Q,R]
 * $RespondsToBetween(S,P,Q,R) = "S responds to P between Q and R (with or without R? this needs to be decided"
 * 
 * After Q until R:
 * S $respondsTo P $after_until [Q,R)
 * S $respondsTo P $after Q $until R
 * S $respondsTo P $after_until [Q,R] -- this also includes R
 * $RespondsToAfterUntil(S,P,Q,R) = "S responds to P after Q until R (with or without R? this needs to be decided!)"

 ******* 7) Precedence Chain pattern - http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/documentation/patterns/precedence-chain.shtml
 * P precedes S,T = "1 cause-2 effect precedence chain"
 * S,T precedes P = "2 cause-1 effect precedence chain"
 *
 ******* 8) Response Chain pattern - http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/documentation/patterns/response-chain.shtml
 * S,T responds to P = "1 stimulus-2 response chain"
 * P responds to S,T = "2 stimulus-1 response chain"
 *
 ******* 9) Constrained Chain pattern - http://patterns.projects.cis.ksu.edu/documentation/patterns/constrained.shtml
 * S,T without Z responds to P = "1-2 response chain constrained by a single proposition"
 *
 *
 ******* For patterns 7, 8, 9 we must design a way to create complex structures like SET and SEQUENCE.
 * complex temporal constraints => complex behaviour
 *
 * Set = in a set, each element may occur only once
 * Sequence = each element may be present more than once and all elements are ordered
 *
 * $set[S,T]
 * P $precedes $set[S,T] = "P precedes S,T"
 * $set[S,T] $precedes P = "S,T precedes P"
 * $set[S,T] $respondsTo P = "S,T responds to P"
 *
 * $sequence[S,T]
 * $sequence[S,T,Z] $precedes P = "S precedes T,T precedes Z, Z precedes P"
 * $sequence[S,T,Z] $respondsTo P = "if P happens, then S happens, then T and finally Z as a response to P"
